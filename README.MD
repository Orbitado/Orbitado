My focus is on delivering pixel-perfect UI, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience through best practices in modern web development.<br><br>Currently, at Bettershore (Switzerland), I work closely with clients to understand their needs and deliver customized solutions. I‚Äôve played a key role in optimizing dynamic routing with Next.js (SSR/SSG), reducing load times and improving app efficiency. Additionally, I design scalable database architectures using PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM, ensuring seamless data management for high-traffic applications.<br><br>Previously, at Globant, I led the design of Gloobcamp, a learning platform that prepared students for technical interviews in web development. I also mentored team members on Next.js and TypeScript, helping them improve their problem-solving skills and code quality.<br><br>In addition to development, I have a strong background in team leadership and business management. As co-founder of Zionist Tucum√°n, I managed events of up to 3,000 attendees, coordinating multidisciplinary teams of 70+ people. This experience strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, solve problems quickly, and handle high-pressure environments, all of which translate seamlessly to the tech industry.<br><br>- Skills: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redux, Jest, React Testing Library, Git, SEO, Accessibility, Performance, Lighthouse, Web Vitals.<br><br>- Soft skills: Problem-solving, effective communication, leadership, adaptability, time management, critical thinking.<br><br>I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network.
